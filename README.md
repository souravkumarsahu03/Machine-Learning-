# Machine Learning 
Machine larning is the branch of computer science or data science where it takes the data and find insights from those data's and based on those patterns it's going to predict some future outcomes.
1) Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs) to predict outcomes for new, unseen data.
2) Unsupervised Learning: The model analyzes unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures, such as clustering.
3) Reinforcement Learning: The model learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties to maximize performance in decision-making tasks.

# The Machine Learning Process
* Data Collection: Gathering relevant, high-quality data.
* Training: Feeding data into an algorithm to build a model that identifies patterns.
* Inference/Prediction: Using the trained model to make decisions or predictions on new data.
* Evaluation: Measuring the model's performance and accuracy, aiming for effective generalization to new data. 

# Topics i am covering during my ML journey:
* Introduction to ML
* Image Processing
* OpenCV / Video Processing
* NLP - Natural Language Processing
* To be continued(Learning....)

# Key Applications
Machine learning is integral to various modern technologies, including: 
* Recommendation Systems: Personalized suggestions on streaming platforms or e-commerce.
* Computer Vision: Image and object recognition in autonomous vehicles.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP): Speech recognition and translation.
* Predictive Analytics: Forecasting, fraud detection, and, more recently, generative AI tools.
